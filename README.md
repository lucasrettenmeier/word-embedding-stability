# word-embedding-stability

Code for the experiments in the course of my Master Thesis: Word Embeddings -- Stability and Semantic Change.

Python wrapper for word2vec, GloVe and fastText embeddings, along with operations to transform, align, average over the embeddings, is found under /lib.

The experiments are found under /thesis.
